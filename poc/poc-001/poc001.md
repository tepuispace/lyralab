**Bus Event in golang:** 

**Introduction:** 

Generate a POC to configure the event bugs: NATS, Kakfa and RabbitMQ, to send a message from a rest API client selected the sending mode for golang

**Objective:** 

To send a message by pub/sub, request/reply, and point-to-point communication for one of the event bus types

**Technologies/Tools Used:** 

NATS is a simple, secure, and high-performance open-source messaging system for cloud-native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures. It supports publish/subscribe, request/reply, and point-to-point communication.

Apache Kafka:

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. It's designed to handle real-time data feeds with low-latency and high reliability. Kafka provides the ability to handle real-time data pipeline and streaming applications.

RabbitMQ:

RabbitMQ is a robust and widely adopted open-source messaging system that supports several messaging protocols. It's known for its broad feature set, ease of use, and can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.

All of these messaging systems have Go clients:

NATS has an official Go client: https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go
Apache Kafka has a widely-used Go client by Confluent: https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go
RabbitMQ has an official Go client: https://github.com/streadway/amqp

**Methodology:** Describe the methodology you used to execute the POC. This could include project planning, requirements gathering, development practices, data collection, etc. 

**Implementation:** This section should cover the detailed steps of implementation. It should be clear and comprehensive enough for another user to reproduce your work.

**Results/Findings:** Describe the outcome of your POC. Did the technology or approach work as expected? Include any metrics or data that helps illustrate your results.

**Challenges/Learnings:** Discuss any issues encountered, how they were resolved, and what you learned in the process.

**Conclusions:** Summarize the POC and its outcomes. Was the concept proven? What are the next steps? 

**References:** List any sources of information or data used during the POC.

**Code/Documentation:** Include the complete source code, data sets, and any other documentation generated during the POC. If there's too much code or data to include in the readme file, consider adding them as separate files in your repository.

**Installation/Setup Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run your POC. The objective is to allow others to reproduce your results, so be as detailed as possible.
