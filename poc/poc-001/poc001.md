**Bus Event in golang:** 

**Introduction:** 

Generate a POC to configure the event bugs: NATS, Kakfa and RabbitMQ, to send a message from a rest API client selected the sending mode for golang

**Objective:** 

To send a message by pub/sub, request/reply, and point-to-point communication for one of the event bus types

**Technologies/Tools Used:** 

NATS is a simple, secure, and high-performance open-source messaging system for cloud-native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures. It supports publish/subscribe, request/reply, and point-to-point communication.

Apache Kafka:

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. It's designed to handle real-time data feeds with low-latency and high reliability. Kafka provides the ability to handle real-time data pipeline and streaming applications.

RabbitMQ:

RabbitMQ is a robust and widely adopted open-source messaging system that supports several messaging protocols. It's known for its broad feature set, ease of use, and can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.

All of these messaging systems have Go clients:

NATS has an official Go client: https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go
Apache Kafka has a widely-used Go client by Confluent: https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go
RabbitMQ has an official Go client: https://github.com/streadway/amqp

**Methodology:**  

The idea is to generate a rest api that receives the request and sends it to another microservice and by console generates the received message
